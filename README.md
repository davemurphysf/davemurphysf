### Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

I currently lead the Solutions Engineering team at Postmates.  We're responsible for everything technical and external facing.  I was the first SE hired at Postmates, and I created the team to help scale our business.  And scale we did: 850% in 18 months! ðŸš€

I really enjoy working with customers and partners to make new things or make existing things work together to be more awesome.
