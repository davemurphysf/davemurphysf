### Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Software Development Manager at AWS.  I previously founded the Partner Engineering team at Postmates (and subsequently led Partner Engineering for Uber Direct after Uber acquired Postmates), and I built the team to help scale our white-label business.  And scale we did: 850% in 18 months! ðŸš€
