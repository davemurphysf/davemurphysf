## Hi, I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹

I am currently looking for a new role.  I've previously worked at places like Uber, AWS & Microsoft.

I founded the Partner Engineering team at Postmates (and subsequently led Partner Engineering for Uber Direct after Uber acquired Postmates), and I built the team to help scale our white-label business.  And scale we did: 850% in 18 months! ðŸš€
